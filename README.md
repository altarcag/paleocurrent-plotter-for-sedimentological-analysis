# paleocurrent-plotter-for-sedimentological-analysis
a paleocurrent plotter for plotting a histogram and a rose diagram out of paleocurrent direction values given in azimuth degrees


Sedimentary structures that indicate paleocurrents include: flute marks, ripple marks etc.

Paleocurrents are usually measured with an azimuth, or as a rake on a bedding plane, and displayed with a Rose Diagram to show the dominant direction(s) of flow.

I decided to make this plotter app for making it easy to do one of my homeworks given in (JEO264) Sedimentology class at Hacettepe Uni. I did not want to waste my time drawing the diagrams by hand so I wasted a lot more time for automatizing it.
It can be used without a GUI as well, just run paleo-current.py in your Python IDE. gui.py and moderngui.py basically do the same thing but the moderngui.py looks a lot better, had to come up with it after one of my friends mocked me on how it looks like an early 2000s interface.
A download link for the app will be included here after some minor improvements I need to make on it.
